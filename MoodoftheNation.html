						<p>In this project IBM tasked my group and I to design a web-application that makes analysis of data from twitter easy and provide quick data visualisations.</p>
						<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
						<blockquote>’Many social media analytics tools are designed for professional marketers. Therefore, they are not particularly consumable to a typical social media user who wants to understand how their social media message/request has been received’</blockquote>

							<h3></h3>
							<p>As stated an easy to use interface with sophisticated visualisation was desired. During the project I developed my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and intuitive front-end user interface. I also gained experience in working with various APIs such as the Twitter Developer API and IBM's proprietary machine learning tools.  </p>

						<h3>Solution</h3>
						<p>The solution required various APIs such as the Twitter Developer API and the Firestore Database API which were interfaced and connected together in NodeRED. NodeRED is a browser based flow editor, built on node.js, designed for wiring together various APIs and online services which can then be used to create JavaScript functions. The final product features a dynamic map with coloured indicators designating how many tweets, retweets and sentiment. Also featured </p>

					<h5>IBM problem statement</h5>
					<blockquote>
						<p>Problem to be solved.</p>
						<p>Many social media analytics tools are designed for professional marketers, and so are not particularly consumable to a typical social media user who wants to understand how their social media message/request has been received</p>
						<p>Create</p>
						<p>An application to take as input a hashtag from the user, and analyse Twitter for occurrences of that hashtag (for this application keep the scope to the UK and Ireland)</p>
						<p>Provide a visualisation of the analysis based on a geographic map showing where the tweets originated from, and using color to show if the tweets were original or RT's</p>
						<p>Create and show a ' topic word cloud' that displays the key words that have been used in the tweets (top 20 words used)</p>
						<p>Also highlight any city names or county names included in the tweet in a 'Geographic word cloud'</p>
						<p>Stretch goal - use Watson Tone Analyser to show the emotional content of the tweet</p>
