					<p>The purpose of this project was to enhance my understanding of basic computer architecture on a fundamental level. I was interested in how different components of a basic computer interacted with one another. In this project, inspired by Ben Eater, I assembled a breadboard PC using EEPROM as storage, SRAM as volatile memory and using the W65C02 as the core microprocessor of this computer. The mess of wires in the center serve as the Data and Address bus of the system. </p>

							<p>The diagram on the right outlines how the address bus is wired up. The W65C02 microprocessor has an address width of 16 bits however both the EEPROM and SRAM have 32768 memory locations so only require 15 bits to address each location. The SRAM and EEPROM also have chip select, write enable and output enable pins which are configured using the extra bit from the address bus and other configuration pins from the microprocessor. The write enable of the EEPROM is set to the supply rail as the pin is active low and the processor will never need to write to the EEPROM (the SRAM's write enable is directly connected to the write/enable of the microprocessor so the processor can write to the RAM on demand. </p>

							<p>The device on the left was created to monitor the data and address buses to see what instructions are being exectued and to verify if the program loaded into the EEPROM was executing correctly in sequence. Due to the limited number of pins on an arduino 2 Parallel In Serial Out (PISO) ICs (the 74LS165) are used to expand the number of inputs on the arduino and to collect all 16 bits of the address and 8 bits of the data bus simultaneously multiple times a second. </p>
